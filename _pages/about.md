  <strong>🔬 Research Vision:</strong> My research lies at the intersection of digital construction, human-building interaction, and intelligent sensing, with a focus on scalable and data-driven solutions for the built environment.
</div>

I received my B.Eng in Civil Engineering from Hohai University in China (2017), and obtained my Ph.D. in Construction Management from the National University of Singapore (NUS) in 2024. My research centers on the Digitalization of the Built Environment, structured within a 3Ps framework (**Figure 1**): **Process** (Building Information Modeling - BIM), **People** (human-built environment interactions), and **Product** (robotics and automation).
