  <strong>üî¨ Research Vision:</strong> My research lies at the intersection of digital construction, human-building interaction, and intelligent sensing, with a focus on scalable and data-driven solutions for the built environment.
</div>

I received my B.Eng in Civil Engineering from Hohai University in China (2017), and obtained my Ph.D. in Construction Management from the National University of Singapore (NUS) in 2024. My research centers on the Digitalization of the Built Environment, structured within a 3Ps framework (**Figure 1**): **Process** (Building Information Modeling - BIM), **People** (human-built environment interactions), and **Product** (robotics and automation).

### üß™ Research Focus

#### a) Human-Building Interactions
- Developed sensor-to-dashboard applications integrating data analytics and ML to optimize occupant behavior and building performance.  
- Utilized IoT systems for real-time monitoring and decision-making in smart facilities.

#### b) Smart Sensing Technology
- Deployed fiber-optic and IoT-based sensing for automated data collection and lifecycle analysis.  
- Integrated structured/unstructured data to enhance real-time visualization and digital workflows.

#### c) Building Information Modeling (BIM)
- Developed AI-based automation for BIM workflows, enabling seamless model coordination and team collaboration.  
- Applied optimization for improved design coordination and decision-making.

#### d) Automated Code Compliance Checking (ACCC)
- Leveraged deep learning and conceptual graphs to automate regulatory verification.  
- Contributed to efficient, accurate, and transparent digital compliance workflows.
