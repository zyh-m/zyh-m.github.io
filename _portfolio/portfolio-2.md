title: "Large Scale Indoor Occupant Tracking Using Distributed Acoustic Sensing"
collection: portfolio
---

Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) system is a nonintrusive sensor. While DAS has been successfully applied in various long-distance scenarios, such as pipeline surveillance and real-time train tracking, its effectiveness in footfall detection requires further evaluation. This portfolio presents a few results of our collected data.
