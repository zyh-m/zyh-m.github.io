title: "Conceptual Graph for Automated Code Compliance Checking"
excerpt: "The rules in building codes are composed of language, logic structure, and the embedded knowledge that requires further articulation
from rule experts. This greatly increases the complexity of rule interpretation. The conceptual graph (CG) is used as a graph-based
representation method to capture such knowledge and transfer it to other actors in the compliance checking process. This portfolio presents a group of reusable CGs developed by us. <br/><img src='/images/project_1.png' width='300'> Figure 1. Extended CG notations"
